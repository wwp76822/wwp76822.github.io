I was born and raised in Glennville, Georgia.  I graduated from a small private school called Pinewood Christian Academy where I excelled athletically, socially, and academically.  I was born and raised in Glennville, Georgia, and I graduated from a small private school called Pinewood Christian Academy.  At Pinewood, I participated in many extracurricular activities, all while keeping a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.96</span> GPA.  I played three sports and completed nearly 150 hours of community service.  I am glad I excelled in high school because it got me accepted into the<b>University of Georgia</b>.</p>
<p>
Since I have been at the <b>University of Georgia</b>, I have been involved in extracurriculars as well.  My GPA is not as good, but it is only lower by a few points at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.88</span>.  My fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho, is the main thing I have spent time with outside of school since I have been made the transition into college.  Many people think fraternities are just for partying, but a lot of my success is because I have a group of people that push me to be a better student and get involved around campus.  Besides my fraternity, I have been involved in the Interfraternity Council, UGA Miracle, and intramural sports.</p>

<p>
In the future, I hope to get an internship and eventually get a job as a financial analyst after I graduate with <I>magna cum laude</I> honors.  I am also considering a Master's of Accountancy to go along with my finance major. Besides that, I am not sure what my future holds.</p>
